# 100 Days of Code Challenge

I've publicly commited to do the [100 days of Code Challenge](https://www.
100daysofcode.com/). My decision is to follow the challenge to get more done on my 
side projects refreshing my Personal Portfolio while getting much more active on Twitter.

The main aim of the challenge is to just complete the 1 hour per day of coding (on 
personal projects) and tweeting about it. It's about building the habit and 
working on small efforts that compound on another.

One of the main issues I've had in the past was _not knowing what to actually do._ 
Well, this time around I've learned a bit more about what I can _realistically_ do, 
and what is actually useful for me and hopefully others too.

### Here are some _principles_ I plan to follow:
- Code 1 hour per day
- Tweet at least once a day about it
- Engage in individual conversations, connecting to other people one at a time.
- Work on **one** project at a time, and complete it before starting the next one.

### Projects:
The primary project is to upgrade my [personal site](www.felixtellmann.com). My aim is 
to rebuild the site with a fresh design and some new underlying technology to add on 
to an interesting learning process. I also plan on adding new portfolio items that are 
actually useful, an active blog and much more.

For the side projects I've got the following in mind:
- Contribute to Shopify's node api package, by adding Typescript types for their Rest 
  API. (I've personally developed a Shopify App thats currently under review to be 
  published and it's definitely been something that I could have needed in the process.
  I've already created a mini version of the functionality, which allowed me to add the 
  Types on a per request basis.)
- Cooking Recipe mini CMS. (My Wife and I are both trained chefs and love cooking. 
  Recently, Liz got back into posting a lot on Instagram about our Cooking & hosting 
  journey where we invite our friends and cook 3-5 course menus. We have never really 
  shared or even written down some of our recipes. The idea for the Project is to 
  build a mini platform for us to publish our recipes and have it on our 
  SearchForFlavour website.)
- Habit Tracking Online Sheet
- Weekly Planning App
